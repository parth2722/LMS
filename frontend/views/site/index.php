        <h2>Learning management system</h2>
        <p>What is a learning management system (LMS)?
            A learning management system is a software or web-based technology used to plan, implement and assess a specific learning process. It's used for e-learning practices and, in its most common form, consists of two elements:
            a server that performs the base functionality and a user interface (UI) that is operated by instructors, students and administrators.
            Typically, an LMS provides an instructor with a way to create and deliver content, monitor student participation, and assess student performance. It might also provide students with interactive features,
            such as threaded discussions, video conferencing and discussion forums.
        </p>
        <h3>What are learning management systems used for?</h3>
        <p>LMSes are beneficial to a range of organizations, including higher education institutions and companies. They're primarily used for knowledge management: the gathering, organizing,
            sharing and analysis of an organization's knowledge in terms of resources, documents and people skills. The role of the LMS varies according to the organization's training strategy and goals.</p>

        <h3>Onboarding and training</h3>
        <p>Employee training and onboarding are two common uses of LMSes in a business environment. For onboarding, the LMS helps train new employees, providing opportunities to access training programs across various devices.
            New employees are able to add their own knowledge and provide feedback, helping employers understand
            how effective the training course materials are and identify areas where new hires need assistance.</p>
